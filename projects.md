Work in Progress!

An overview of each project that I have completed throughout my education and a link to the corresponding repository on GitHub. I intend to include some of my side projects that I have been working on once they are complete! Links to my professional work for Shew Properties can be obtained by contacting me directly.

## Games, Drawing, Manipulation, and Media
#### Snake

A classic game originating in 1976 from Blockade is re-envisioned on the XWindows System, coded on C++98.

When your score reaches 20, a new level begins and the speed at which the snake travels is increased. Can you reach a high score of "Level 5"?

#### Doodle

Drawing has never been more exquisite until the addition of animated undo and redo. Watch your drawing seamlessly undraw itself at the press of a button!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/doodle.gif)


Complimented with a customizable colour palette, your ability to create intricate and elegant illustrations is only enhanced. What can you make with this new sketcher?

#### Paper Dolls

A humanoid figure is interesting in the ways its body parts can be manipulated. The upper arms (shoulders) can rotate a full 360° while lower arms (elbows) only 135°; why is that?

Explore the limits of what the paper doll can do in this experimental and interactive application! What is a position the paper doll can be in that you can't?

#### YouTube GUI

YouTube is widely known as a leader in the video sharing platform with over five billion videos watched every day!
