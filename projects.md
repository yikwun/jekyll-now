Work in Progress!

An overview of each project that I have completed throughout my education and a link to the corresponding repository on GitHub. I intend to include some of my side projects that I have been working on once they are complete! Links to my professional work for Shew Properties can be obtained by contacting me directly.

## Games, Drawing, Manipulation, and Media
#### Snake

A classic game originating in 1976 from Blockade is re-envisioned on the XWindows System, coded on C++98. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/snake.png){: .center }


When your score reaches 20, a new level begins and the speed at which the snake travels is increased. Can you reach a high score of "Level 5"?

#### Doodle

Drawing has never been more exquisite until the addition of animated undo and redo. Watch your drawing seamlessly undraw itself at the press of a button!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/doodle.gif){: .center }


Complimented with a customizable colour palette, your ability to create intricate and elegant illustrations is only enhanced. What can you make with this new sketcher?

#### Paper Dolls

A humanoid figure is interesting in the ways its body parts can be manipulated. The upper arms (shoulders) can rotate a full 360° while lower arms (elbows) only 135°; why is that?

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/paper-dolls.png){: .center }


Explore the limits of what the paper doll can do in this experimental and interactive application! What is a position the paper doll can be in that you can't?

#### YouTube GUI

YouTube is widely known as a leader in the video sharing platform with over five billion videos watched every day. I have created an application that can save your favourite videos from a search on YouTube, while also providing a functionality to rate videos locally. Ultimately, a collection of all your favourite videos are compiled into one place which can be accessed instantly! The following images were created using the search query "cat".

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/youtube01.png){: .center }


This is an example of the graph view implemented by the application. Resizing will dynamically change the number of videos displayed on each row. Each query is limited to 25 search results.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/youtube02.png){: .center }


An example of the list view implemented by the application. Switching between the two views will not reset any ratings assigned to each video. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/youtube03.png){: .center }


An example of the list view in combination with the filter applied to the search results. In this case, only videos with a rating of two or more stars are displayed.

## Are You Healthy?

As emerging technologies gradually conquer the digital era, the software that powers them become ever more important. A combination of the smartwatch with the smartphone... (not finished)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/healthee.png){: .center }


Note: Graph does not contain any data because no smartwatch was connected at the time this image was captured.
