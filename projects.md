Work in Progress!

An overview of each project that I have completed throughout my education and a link to the corresponding repository on GitHub. I intend to include some of my side projects that I have been working on once they are complete! Links to my professional work for Shew Properties can be obtained by contacting me directly.

## Games, Drawing, Manipulation, and Media
#### Snake

A classic game originating in 1976 from Blockade is re-envisioned on the XWindows System, coded on C++98.

When your score reaches 20, a new level begins and the speed at which the snake travels is increased. Can you reach the benchmark of "Level 5"?

#### Doodle

Drawing has never been more interactive with the addition of animated undo and redo. Watch your drawing seamlessly undraw itself at the press of a button!
