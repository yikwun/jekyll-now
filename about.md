Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Yikwun Zhang, a student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie mainly in developing elegant designs for applications focused around creating an intuitive user experience and environment. I also enjoy learning about other areas of computer science and software engineering in general such as information security, database management, and web development. 

I have experience creating many different user interfaces for multiple platforms such as desktop, mobile, and web. Please have a look at my Projects page where I go into further detail about some of the projects I have completed!

Although my focus is software development, my studies have allowed me to pursue my secondary interest of business where I have learned about business strategy, marketing, human resources, and simple bookkeeping through courses and case studies.
