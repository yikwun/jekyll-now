Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Yikwun Zhang, a student currently studying at the University of Waterloo.
My interests lie mainly in developing elegant designs focused around creating the best user interaction and experience.
However, I enjoy learning about all the diverse areas of software development such as computer security & privacy, database management, and web development.

I have experience creating many different user interfaces for multiple platforms such as desktop, mobile, and web. Please have a look at my Projects page where I go into further detail about some of the projects I have completed!
