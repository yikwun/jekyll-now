## Overview

My name is Yikwun Zhang, a student currently studying Computer Science (Software Engineering Option) with a Management Studies Minor at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie mainly in developing beautiful designs for applications, targeted at creating an intuitive and meaningful user experience. My beliefs are that having to look at manuals or guides, in regards to navigation, are the result of poor design of the developer. Therefore, recognition and consistency are two quintessential factors in designing for the user.

I also enjoy learning about other areas of computer science and software engineering including information security, database management, and web development. The information security industry fascinates me and puts into perspective how vast the world actually is. Ranging from simple exploits like buffer overflows or TOCTTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) attacks, to complex web attacks such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) or XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, to even database vulnerabilities like SQL-injections, the idea that one small misstep in implementing preventative measures can cause such massive repercussions is definitely a scary thought, and one we'd all like to avoid.

Business has always been my secondary interest apart from technology, and pursuing a minor in management has allowed me to gain formal education on topics such as business strategy, marketing, human resources, and simple bookkeeping. Successfully managing the financial aspects of a business, especially startups with little to no capital in the early phases, is the key factor and is ultimately what differentiates the successful and profitable companies from the unsuccessful ones.

## Software and Technologies

#### C\#
My passion for computer science stemmed from my enjoyment for the course offered in high school. As the curriculum focused around creating games using **C#**, I was introduced to the computer science fundamentals such as data types, functions, object oriented programming, code execution flow, and general problem solving skills over the final **two years** of high school, which has helped me significantly during my transition to university.

#### C & C++
The University of Waterloo has significantly enhanced my knowledge of computers. Software abstraction & modularization, data structures, computer architecture, and operating systems were topics I studied for **more than one year**, supplmented with implementation in **C**. I have also learned more about object-oriented development, compilers, and algorithms, making use of concepts regarding memory management as well as _STL_ in **C++** for **over one year**. Furthermore, I was exposed to the **UNIX System**, using **BASH**, around this time and have been using it ever since to write simple _shell scripts_ and access the file system through the command line.

#### Java
User-focused design followed subsequently and this allowed me to learn a new language. **Java** came naturally as the syntax mirrored the C language, and garbage collection meant less worries about memory leaks. With projects utilizing _Swing_ and _AWT_, I was able to learn how to correctly use widgets to create interaction between humans and computers. Furthermore, I worked with **Android Studio** to create an Android application that uses two devices - a smartphone and a smartwatch. Recently, I have completed a project focused on applied cryptography involving the _libsodium_ library. Cumulatively, I have worked with Java for **over one year**, but would consider this to be my strongest language.

#### SQL
I have also been exposed to databases, learning how to write **SQL Queries** and accessing IBM's **DB2** database provided through the command line. I would consider my knowledge in databases to be extremely limited, as I only have roughly **four months** of experience working with databases. I have also been exposed to some _Big Data_ tools such as **Hadoop**, but there is still a lot I have to learn about the _Data Science_ field.

#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Outside of formal education, I have also dabbled in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, learning the basics of how webpages are deployed and displayed on the web. My time at _Hatch Canada_ has introduced me to a library known as _p5.js_ for JavaScript that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications focused around drawing. I also have basic knowledge on how to access elements on a page using JavaScript as a result of my time at _Shew Properties_, in addition to learning about JavaScript from a security perspective from a course named _Computer Security & Privacy_. Moreover, this website was created using the _Jekyll Theme_ and written in _Markdown_.

#### Git
I am also familiar with version control tools such **Git**. Initially using the university's version known as _GitLab_, I recently transferred a few of my projects onto _GitHub_ to showcase my accomplishments.

## Interests & Hobbies

Growing up, I was never exposed to large variety of foods very often and usually ate the same cuisine every meal. As a result, I developed an interest in learning more about different **cooking** styles and began exploring different techniques and ingredients to evolve my own creations when cooking. After countless meals, my skills in the kitchen have evolved significantly and eventually, I found myself cooking nearly every meal whenever I visit home.

After years of not touching the **piano**, my interest for the instrument recently began resurfacing after being inspired. When I was around 13, I had successfully completed Grade 8 Piano from the _Royal Conservatory of Music_ and the transition back to piano was initially rough, but the techniques I had learnt were gradually coming back to me. Since then, I have learned to play a quite a few songs such as [Canon in D]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/piano-canon.pdf){:target="_blank" __}, [River Flows In You]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/piano-river.pdf){:target="_blank" __}, _Wedding Dress_, and more recently, [Orange]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/piano-orange.pdf){:target="_blank" __} from _Your Lie in April_.
