## Overview

My name is Yikwun Zhang, a student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie mainly in developing elegant designs for applications focused around creating an intuitive user experience and environment. I also enjoy learning about other areas of computer science and software engineering in general which includes information security, database management, and web development. 

I have experience creating many different user interfaces for multiple platforms such as desktop, mobile, and web. Please have a look at my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) where I go into further detail about some of the projects I have completed!

Although my focus is software development, my studies have allowed me to pursue my secondary interest in the field of business where I have learned about topics such as business strategy, marketing, human resources, and simple bookkeeping. 

## Software and Technologies

My passion for computer science stemmed from my enjoyment for the field in high school. As the course curriculum focused around creating games using **C#**, I was introduced to the computer science fundamentals such as data types, functions, object oriented programming, code execution flow, and general problem solving over the final **two years** of high school.

The University of Waterloo has significantly enhanced my knowledge of computers. Software abstraction & modularization, data structures, computer architecture, and operating systems were topics I studied for **more than one year**, supplmented with implementation in **C**. I have also learned more about object-oriented development, compilers, and algorithms, making use of concepts regarding memory management as well as _STL_ in **C++** for **over one year**. Furthermore, I was exposed to the **UNIX System**, using **BASH**, around this time and have been using it ever since to write simple _shell scripts_ and access the file system through the command line. 

User-focused design followed subsequently and this allowed me to learn a new language. **Java** came naturally as the syntax mirrored the C language, and garbage collection meant less worries about memory leaks. With projects utilizing _Swing_ and _AWT_, I was able to learn how to correctly use widgets to create interaction between humans and computers. Furthermore, I worked with **Android Studio** to create an Android application that uses two devices - a smartphone and a smartwatch. Recently, I have also completed a project focused on applied cryptography involving the _libsodium_ library. Cumulatively, I have worked with Java for **over one year**, but would consider this to be my strongest language. 

I have also been exposed to databases, learning how to write **SQL Queries** and accessing IBM's **DB2** database provided through the command line. I would consider my knowledge in databases to be extremely limited, as I only have roughly **four months** of experience working with databases.

Outside of formal education, I have also dabbled in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, learning the basics of how webpages are deployed and displayed on the web. My time at _Hatch Canada_ has introduced me to a library known as _p5.js_ for JavaScript that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications focused around drawing. I also have basic knowledge on how to access elements on a page using JavaScript as a result of my time at _Shew Properties_, in addition to learning about JavaScript from a security perspective from a course named _Computer Security & Privacy_. Moreover, this website was created using the _Jekyll Theme_ and written in _Markdown_.

I am also familiar with version control tools such **GIT**. Initially using the university's version known as _GitLab_, I recently transferred a few of my projects onto _GitHub_ to showcase my accomplishments.

## Interests & Hobbies

Growing up, I was never exposed to large variety of foods very often and usually ate the same cuisine every meal. As a result, I developed an interest in learning more about different **cooking** styles and began exploring different techniques and ingredients to evolve my own creations when cooking. After countless meals, my skills in the kitchen have evolved significantly and eventually, I found myself cooking nearly every meal whenever I visit home. 

After years of not touching the **piano**, my interest for the instrument recently began resurfacing after being inspired. When I was around 13, I had successfully completed Grade 8 Piano from the Royal Conservatory of Music and the transition back to piano was initially rough, but the techniques I had learnt were gradually coming back to me. Since then, I have learned to play a quite a few songs such as _Canon in D_, _River Flows In You_, and _Wedding Dress_. I am currently in the process of learning a very difficult song known as _Orange_ from an anime called _Your Lie in April_.
