## What is Shew Properties?

[Shew Properties](https://www.shewproperties.com){:target="_blank" __} is a team of real estate professionals, backed by over 30 years of experience, specializing in pre-construction condominium projects throughout the Greater Toronto Area. They offer exclusive incentives and platinum first access to new projects which are only available to clients because of their close connections and great relationships with large developers such as Pemberton Group, IN8 Developments, and Great Gulf.

Below is a list of relevant websites that I have either created individually or had a significant role in developing.

- [Shew Properties](https://www.shewproperties.com){:target="_blank" __}
- [9th & Main](https://www.9thlineandmaincondos.com/){:target="_blank" __} - Stouffville
- [Empress Park Towns](https://www.empressparktowns.com/){:target="_blank" __} - Toronto
- [Erin Square Condos](https://www.erinsquarecondominiums.com/){:target="_blank" __} - Mississauga
- [DTK Condos](https://www.dtkitchenercondos.com/){:target="_blank" __} - Downtown Kitchener

## Main Website Total Redesign

As almost half of all people in the world are already on the Internet, Shew Properties wanted to expand their marketing efforts and capture a greater share of clients in this massive platform. To accomplish this, informative pages coupled with intuitive navigation on a beautifully designed website was essential. I was tasked with creating a design such that:
- Layouts can be easily extended when new projects are added
- Navigation between pages for different projects is simple and intuitive
- Key points of a project are highlighted
- The bounce rate (single page visits) of the website is lowered

### Phase 0 (Initial Design in October 2017)

![shewproperties]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projects/shew-p0.jpg){: .center .width-75}
<div class="caption"> Featured Projects does not take up full width of the window size </div>

#### Problems with the Current Design
- Unprofessional background design, drew attention away from projects
- Featured projects does not take advantage of the full width of a window size
- Too much white space
- Navigation between pages non-existent, must first go back to home page

### Phase 1 (Redesign in December 2017)

#### Problems Addressed
- Each project now dynamically stretches to fit the full width of the window
- Background removed entirely with the addition of full width rows
- Navigation between pages is solved using a floating side bar
- More attention is drawn towards each individual project

<div class="caption"> Slideshow featuring different featured projects </div>

![shewproperties]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projects/shew-p1-2.jpg){: .center .width-75}
<div class="caption"> Projects displayed in row format, making use of full-width elements </div>

#### Problems with the Current Design
- Difficult to expand and maintain layout (switching the order of projects)
- Little functionality provided with not enough information about each project
- Navigation menu hinders view on certain pages
- Slideshow takes up too much space and draws attention away from projects

### Phase 2 (Redesign in May 2018)

#### Problems Addressed
- Revert back to initial design while making use of full width elements
- Separate projects into sections: featured projects, new releases, coming soon, and sold out
- Navigation menu replaced with Google Custom Search on header
- Slideshow replaced with simple image introducing Shew Properties

#### Additional Features Added
- Links to individual project sites added
- Additional information about the team is available at the bottom

## Individual Development Pages

Demand for individual pages of projects began increasing when advertising trends indicated that individual sites received more traffic than ones embedded within another site. Therefore, I proposed the idea that each major project should be contained in a separate website for better advertising.

#### Pros
- Users are more inclined to visit individual websites
- Showcase project without distractions of other projects
- Better analytics for each project

#### Cons
- Focuses on project success rather than building brand recognition
- Difficult to rank higher in search results
- Requires additional financing for advertising

### Solution
Overall, the team decided that individual websites would increase client turnover and assigned me with the task for each major project they were offering. I've included a few images of websites I've created that are displayed below.

<div class="caption"> 9th & Main - Stouffville </div>
